# About Dataset

* The test image [ILSVRC2012_val_00000178.JPEG](./ILSVRC2012_val_00000178.JPEG) for this example comes from [ILSVRC2012](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset `Val images`. It is used for verifying the inference results of MobileNetV1 model running on Corstone-320 FVP. 
* ImagetNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. The project has been instrumental in advancing computer vision and deep learning research. The data is available for free to researchers for non-commercial use.
